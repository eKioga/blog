# My Blog & Portfolio site

This is the site I plan to use for showcasing things I've learned and struggles I've gone through in terms of technology along with my various subjects and projects I've gone through.

This site also doubles as my learning tool or production environment while I explore my passion for DevOps and automation. This site is deploy using tools like Ansible and Capistrano. As of now, this site is sitting on an LXC wich is hosted on my ProxMox server. Then No-IP handles the internal/external routing via the DUC agent. Once I finish my AWS cert, my goal is to by a domain name and update my ansible script to provision to AWS. 

## Let's build this blog app in 2 easy steps!

The whole process, start to finish, is both easy and difficult, depending on how you approach it. I do want to be clear that I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who didn't have any prior programming experience beyond "Hello World". If I can do it, anybody can.  
 
## Step 1. The Odin Project - theodinproject.com 

The Odin Project is a guided, free and open source curriculum geared towards teaching people how to build Ruby on Rails apps. The only prerequisite you need is the ability to navigate to their website using a computer and start at step 1. You'll quickly learn how to turn your computer into a development machine and go from there. Be prepared for it to take a month or two to complete. But, if you stick with it and complete the full course, you'll know enough about full stack web development to go in just about any direction you want. For me personally, I'm not too interested in web development as a whole, but thanks to The Odin Project, I now have a solid foundation in programming and working with frameworks while following best practices. All of it has been extremely helpful in terms of my own DevOps education. I can say that, at least with my experience so far, the only differences between the two fields mostly depends on what sort of code base I'm working out of. 
 
## Step 2. The Machenzie Child Blog & Portfolio tutorial 
**youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23ZvcdS3XPK9Y4DRU-BiJtiY5L_QhUUq**

This is the guy who did the tutorial for the site your looking at now. I originally started it just for some rails practice but I quickly fell in love with the front end design of it. It did exactly what I wanted, no more, no less. Most tutorials like this are bare bones in the visual department but Machenzie walks you through all of his CSS decisions which was really cool to watch.  

Anyways, I know what your thinking. Eric, why not just start here and just follow along with this guy's videos? Well, you could do that. However, you'll quickly run into one small issue right away. The tutorial was uploaded back in 2015. My experience following along mostly led to one outdated, incompatible or broken feature after another.  

At first, the series looks like it can be completed in a weekend. But, I can tell you there is a big reason why it took me a few weeks to complete it. It would sometimes take me about a day to just make it through two videos because of all the errors I'd run into. Tons of pausing and researching the actual modern day solutions or workarounds just to get the same point as he was at the end of each video was tough but very rewarding. Most importantly though, I was able to deduce the errors and find their sources purely because of my experiences with working with Ruby and Rails while I was going through The Odin Project. If I had skipped right to the blog tutorial, I doubt that I'd have any idea what's going on. It would all look like voodoo. Since I understood the Ruby syntax along with the Rails RESTful framework and MVC concepts goin into the tutorials, I was then able to troubleshoot way more efficiently while minimizing the whole bumbling around in the dark sort of deal.

I know It's possible to cheese it by working with the same exact ruby and gem versions he did, but I wanted to challenge myself by using the latest versions of everything and making it all work. I recommend that you do too. I also want you to beware that some of the API's he recommends are no longer completely free and are a bit trickier to set up now. Especially if you're like me and prefer to use your own hardware instead of Heroku.
