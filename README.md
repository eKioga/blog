# My Blog & Portfolio site

This is the site I plan to use for showcasing things I've learned and struggles I've gone through in terms of technology along with my various subjects and projects I've gone through.

This site also doubles as my learning tool or production environment while I explore my passion for DevOps and automation. This site is deploy using tools like Ansible and Capistrano. As of now, this site is sitting on an LXC wich is hosted on my ProxMox server. Then No-IP handles the internal/external routing via the DUC agent. Once I finish my AWS cert, my goal is to by a domain name and update my ansible script to provision to AWS. 

# How I did it

The Youtube tutorial series by Mackenzie Child was a huge help. Especially how he walks you through his front-end design. His videos where an amazing boost when it comes to getting this out there soon while learning a ridiculous amount at the same time. As I get more time, I plan on adding more features along with editing the design a bit.
